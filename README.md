# Acceptance Criteria 
The password generator fulfills the below acceptance criteria: 

* A button initiates the password generation process
* A series of prompts asks a user for password criteria
* User is able to select which criteria to include in the password
* Length of the generated password is between 8 - 128 characters
* User is able to choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters with each prompt 
* All user input is validated

  // loop getting random characters
  for (let i = 0; i < (parseInt(passwordLength) - minimumCount); i++) {
    var randomNumberPicked = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4);

    randomPasswordGenerated += randomNumberPicked;

  }

  // to make sure characters are added to the password
  randomPasswordGenerated += minimumNumbers;
  randomPasswordGenerated += minimumLowerCases;
  randomPasswordGenerated += minimumUpperCases;
  randomPasswordGenerated += minimumSpecialCharacters;
  return randomPasswordGenerated;
